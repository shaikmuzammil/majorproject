We all search on google for something and get the results in the form of different websites with some description. We generally click on first or second website links if results are not found we go down on google page. The website ranking is given by search engines by different criteria. Last website wonâ€™t be seen by none of the people in most cases and first website will be having a great market compared to last website. So, we need to help the last website to be moved up in results and help in generating revenue and have good rank on searching by giving feedback. This system will provide the difference between the first website and last website on the google results and will provide the feedback to the last website like content, links, images used by first website which helps the last website to be used in his webpage. This system is user friendly which is built on HTML as frontend and Python as backend and used python package beautiful soup to parse HTML data and selenium web driver to automate browser behavior with python. This system is done on web mining which has three categories firstly web content mining in which we scan the web pages and get to know the links, text, images used. Secondly web usage mining in which reports are generated after analysis which contain the details of text, images, links. Finally, the web structure mining states that structural summary of website.
